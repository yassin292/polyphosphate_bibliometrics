##  Software & R Environment

All analyses were conducted using:

- R (v4.x.x)
- RStudio Desktop (v20xx.x.x)
- R Packages:
  - `bibliometrix`
  - `dplyr`
  - `ggplot2`

---

##  Methodological Information

**Data Collection:**  
Web of Science Core Collection was searched using two queries:

- **Yeasts:**  
  `TS = (polyphosphate OR "poly-P" OR "polyphosphates") AND (yeast OR yeasts)`

- **Microalgae:**  
  `TS = (polyphosphate OR "poly-P" OR "polyphosphates") AND (microalgae OR microalga OR phytoplankton OR microphyte)`

Each query was limited to the years **2000â€“2025** and exported as **Full Record and Cited References (Plain Text)**.

**Data Analysis Steps (see `biblio_analysis.R`):**
1. Load and convert `.txt` data with `convert2df()`
2. Clean and align datasets
3. Merge and label by organism group
4. Run descriptive `biblioAnalysis()`
5. Plot annual publication trends using `ggplot2`

##  Figures & Tables

-  **Figure S2**: Line graph showing the annual number of publications related to polyphosphate for yeasts vs. microalgae (2000â€“2025).  
  *(Saved as: `figures/Figure_S2_publication_trend.png`)*

-  **Table S1**: Bibliometric summary report (total publications, top authors, keywords, annual growth rate, etc.).  
  *(Saved as: `summary_report.txt`)*
